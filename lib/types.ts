/**
 * MDT Loop — domain model.

 * The organising concept is the LOOP: a structured request from one discipline
 * to another that is not considered finished until the person who asked
 * confirms the answer resolved the question. Patients, tumour board sessions
 * and metrics all hang off that.
 *
 * Types are plain and serialisable so `lib/data.ts` can be replaced by an API
 * (Chameleon / Ofek via FHIR-IL) without touching the component tree.
